#FTK Imager: A Forensic Imaging Tool Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive overview of FTK Imager, a widely-used tool in digital forensics for creating forensic images and previewing digital evidence.

What is FTK Imager?
FTK (Forensic Toolkit) Imager is a free data preview and imaging tool from Exterro (formerly AccessData). It allows for the acquisition of electronic evidence in a forensically sound manner by creating exact copies (forensic images) of computer data without altering the original evidence. This is a critical first step in any digital investigation.

Key Features
FTK Imager is packed with powerful features that make it an essential tool for digital forensics professionals:

Forensic Image Creation: Creates perfect, bit-for-bit copies of various data sources, including:

Local hard drives (HDD/SSD)

Removable devices (USB drives, SD cards)

CDs and DVDs

Individual files or folders

Multiple Image Formats: Supports creation of images in various formats, including:

DD (raw)

E01 (EnCase Evidence File)

S01 (SMART)

AFF (Advanced Forensics Format)

Data Preview: Allows you to preview the contents of a drive or image file without making any changes. You can browse the file system, view file contents, and even recover deleted files that haven't been overwritten.

Image Mounting: Mount a forensic image as a read-only drive in Windows. This allows you to view the evidence exactly as the user would have seen it and use other tools (like antivirus scanners) on the data.

Hashing: Generates MD5 and SHA1 hash values for files and the entire forensic image. This is crucial for verifying the integrity of the evidence and maintaining the chain of custody.

Memory Capture: Captures live memory (RAM) from a running computer, which can contain valuable volatile data that would be lost if the system were shut down.

Why is FTK Imager Important in Digital Forensics?
Forensically Sound: It ensures that the original evidence is not altered in any way, which is a fundamental requirement for evidence to be admissible in court.

Preservation of Evidence: By creating an exact copy, investigators can work with the image file, leaving the original evidence untouched and preserved.

Integrity Verification: The use of hash values proves that the forensic image is an identical copy of the original and has not been tampered with.

Triage and Preview: It allows for a quick assessment of the evidence to determine if a full, in-depth analysis is warranted, saving time and resources.

Basic Workflow
A typical workflow for using FTK Imager might look like this:

Connect the Evidence: Connect the source drive to a forensic workstation using a write-blocker to prevent any accidental writes to the drive.

Create a Disk Image: Open FTK Imager and select the source drive. Choose the destination for the image file and the desired image format.

Fill in Evidence Information: Add case details, examiner name, and a description of the evidence.

Start Imaging: Begin the imaging process. FTK Imager will create the image file and generate hash values.

Verify Hashes: After the imaging is complete, verify that the hash of the image file matches the hash of the source drive.

Analyze the Image: The created image file can now be analyzed using forensic software like FTK, Autopsy, or EnCase.
